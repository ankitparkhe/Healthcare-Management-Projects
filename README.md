Dashboard Design using Power BI : Healthcare Management

This project was developed as part of my Professional Certificate in Data Science at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.

The objectives of this case study involve addressing the following key areas and providing solutions through data-driven analysis :

1.	Average Patient Wait Time
2.	Bed Occupancy Rate 
3.	Average Length Of Stay 
4.	Revenue By Age Group
5.	Monthly Revenue Generation

This dashboard is particularly designed for private sector healthcare management organizations, enabling them to enhance revenue generation,
optimize budgeting, and implement effective administrative strategies simply by inputting one year of historical data,
leading to better overall management within the organization.
